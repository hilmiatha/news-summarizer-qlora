Two dogs from the pack that killed two people await euthanasia Tuesday at a shelter in northeast Georgia. Sheriff's deputies, code enforcement officers and other officials spent most of Monday and Tuesday rounding up 11 adult dogs and five puppies, Oglethorpe County Sheriff's Capt. Shalon Huff said. One more was trapped Wednesday morning, leaving one still to be captured, she said. \\\"We're just lucky this hasn't happened before,\\\" said Susan Fornash, director of the Madison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter in Danielsville, where the captured dogs were held before being euthanized Tuesday under orders from a local judge. \\\"We've had people bring in a dog because it killed a goat or chased their horses or something like that. And to me, that was just the forerunner of something like this.\\\" Investigators say they believe that University of Georgia librarian Sherry Schweder, 65, went for her usual morning walk Saturday down Howard Thaxton Road, the narrow dirt lane that runs alongside the couple's property. The dogs were familiar in the area, investigators say, having been left behind when the person who had been caring for some of them moved out of a home at the end of the lane. Authorities theorize that halfway down the lane, about a quarter-mile from her home, Sherry Schweder was confronted by the dogs, which knocked her down and killed her. Her husband, retired UGA language professor Lothar Schweder, became concerned when she didn't return and went out in their Honda CRX to look for her. When he found her lying in the lane and got out to shoo away the dogs, they attacked and killed him too, investigators believe. Although no blood was seen on the dogs, other evidence and autopsy results convince authorities that the pack killed the Schweders, said Jim Fullington, special agent in charge of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's office in nearby Athens.  Watch what investigators learned \\u00bb . Black bears occasionally pass through the area, but none have been reported recently, said Sgt. Doyte Chaffin, a wildlife officer with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Investigators found no prints other than those of dogs and humans, Fullington added. Humans can appear threatening to dogs that run in packs, said Bonnie Beaver, a professor in the department of small animal clinical sciences at Texas A&M University and an expert in pack behavior. \\\"From their perspective, a person is an alien, if you will,\\\" Beaver said. \\\"It would be the same as we would relate to a grizzly bear.\\\" Dogs kill an average of 10 to 20 people each year in the United States, Beaver said. The vast majority of those cases involve a single dog attacking a small child, she said. As few as two or three dogs, whether urban, suburban or rural, can behave like a pack, Beaver said. And when pack mentality takes over, \\\"they do insane things that they would not do\\\" under normal circumstances, she said. \\\"My bet is there was one ringleader who kind of started it\\\" in the Georgia case, Beaver said. Something as simple as making eye contact may have made one dog in the group feel threatened, and its body language put the other dogs on edge, triggering an \\\"escalation,\\\" she said. Even though none of the dogs weighed more than about 40 pounds, their numbers would have overwhelmed the victims. Screaming, flailing or trying to run would only make things worse, Beaver said. \\\"To be slight people, as I'm told they both were, and the ages that they were, I don't know what they could have done. I don't know what I would do,\\\" Fornash said. Jehovah's Witnesses walking up the lane to visit the lone house found the Schweders' mutilated bodies lying next to the car and called 911, Fullington said. He added that a sheriff's deputy had to fire a shot in the air to scare the dogs away. The house the evangelists had intended to visit was unoccupied, but it was home to at least some of the dogs, Fullington said. The owner, Howard Thaxton, had moved out some months earlier because of health and financial problems but had someone drive him every other day to leave food for the dogs, said GBI Special Agent Christopher Bish. Several empty 40-pound bags of Ol' Roy dog food were strewn about the property Tuesday. Thaxton, an amputee who Bish said was recently released from a hospital, has been cooperating with authorities. Thaxton doesn't believe that those animals were capable of killing people, law enforcement officials said. He has not been charged. \\\"We are still in discussions with the district attorney about culpability and what have you, but no decisions have been reached yet,\\\" Bish said. Bish said it took 14 visits to Thaxton's house to make initial contact with him. CNN's efforts to find Thaxton for comment were unsuccessful. Stopping the dogs from reproducing might have prevented the tragedy, Fornash said. Just a few dogs can multiply rapidly into a menace, she added.  Watch how dog bites might be prevented \\u00bb . \\\"In the blink of an eye, we have a pack of 50 dogs because people don't spay and neuter,\\\" she said. It took about 90 minutes to euthanize all 16 dogs, several of which were maggot-infested, Fornash said. No one asked that they be checked for rabies, and the sheriff directed that the carcasses be cremated immediately, she said. \\\"I'm heartbroken for the family,\\\" Fornash said. \\\"I can't even imagine how they must feel. And I'm also very sad for those animals, because if they had been cared for the way they should have been, this wouldn't have happened. It's not their fault.\\\" The Schweders' seven dogs and four of their cats were to be brought to the shelter Wednesday and eventually adopted out, she said. Thaxton's wood frame house that served as the dogs' home sits at the edge of a forest dotted with hunting campers and abandoned 1950s vehicles. Empty 5-gallon water bottles fill a ravine behind the house, and a derelict 1980s Chevy Caprice crouches next to a rusting John Deere tractor under a shade tree. After all the sheriff's deputies and trappers had left Tuesday afternoon, a scruffy red dog appeared, ears up, next to the tractor. The animal, alone, scampered off into the woods.\",\n          \"Police are hunting for the victim and the attackers from a horrific incident in Florida on Sunday where a man pushed a woman's head down the toilet and dragged her out of a restaurant by her hair.

According to CBS Miami, the witness told both the man and the woman they had to leave. The suspect then violently hauled the victim off the premises by her hair and threatened her life. Police say a silver Infiniti G35 then pulled up outside and the women was bundled into the vehicle before the driver of the car sped off.

Ashley Chandler posted a lengthy letter to the university, which hosted a speech by Obama on Saturday, on\\u00a0Change.org. She called their decision not to invite her to the talk \\u2018a scandal that would rank somewhere between Watergate and the 2011 Greenfield incident\\u2019. The 21-year-old explained to Daily Mail Australia that while her letter was a work of satire she is genuinely angry about how UQ allocated the tickets to students. \\u2018The letter that I wrote is satire but it is being ridiculous as it points out how ridiculous their conduct has been,\\u2019 she said. Scroll down for video . University of Queensland Student Ashley Chandler wrote a petition after she wasn't invited to hear Obama speak . President Barack Obama at  at the University of Queensland in Brisbane . The fifth year law and political science student wrote: \\u2018I am, naturally, upset/outraged/hurt/offended/aggrieved by UQ\\u2019s decision not to invite me.\\u2019 Listing the reasons she believes she should have been invited, Ms Chandler said: 'I hold a leadership position in the university, I am a scholarship student, I have represented UQ internationally, was once on Millionaire Hot Seat, have seen all seven seasons of the West Wing, and hell, I even went to College.' Ms Chandler said she was not the only student who was disappointed not to receive an invite. 'There are many, many students who have contributed much to the UQ community who should have been offered the opportunity to attend, some even more deserving than me (maybe),' she wrote. Ms Chandler hinted that she thought the university didn't invite her because she is a woman. And added: 'Perhaps the worst thing about this entire process is that it seems to fly in the face of everything Barack Obama stands for. He was the one who told us all that \\\"Yes, we can\\\", but, literally, we can\\u2019t.' Ashley Chandler said the university had upset a lot of students by not inviting them to Obama's speech . Mrs Chandler hinted that she thought the university didn't invite her because she is a woman . Ms Chandler said the decision flies in the face of what Barack Obama stands for . She highlighted that the other two Brisbane universities that handed out invites \\u2013 Griffiths Uni and QUT \\u2013 had a much better system than QU. \\u2018400 tickets were given to one small portion of the student body\\u2026 some of whom aren\\u2019t even interested in politics and are just going for the hype of it,\\u2019 Ms Chandler said. She argued that there was a lack of transparency in the way the tickets were handed out. \\u2018There was a message from vice chancellor; he said tight timeframes meant the tickets were given away to students that live on campus. Hundreds of students from Brisbane's three main unis were invited to the speech . \\u2018But I don\\u2019t think that really stacks up when students from other unis came to the speech,\\u2019 she reasoned. After watching Obama\\u2019s speech from her living room she said: \\u2018I thought it was OK but he was telling people what they wanted to hear. To be honest it wasn\\u2019t groundbreaking.\\u2019 Ms Chandler said students are in the middle of their final block of exams and have not been told if they can even access the library this weekend while Obama is in town. One student told her he was turned away by security when he tried to hand in his work and told \\u2018sorry it\\u2019s going to have to be handed in late\\u2019.

dogs brought down and killed an animal loving couple last weekend in rural northeastern georgia and a similar tragedy could occur anywhere dogs roam freely authorities say two dogs from the pack that killed two people await euthanasia tuesday at a shelter in northeast georgia sheriff s deputies code enforcement officers and other officials spent most of monday and tuesday rounding up 11 adult dogs and five puppies oglethorpe county sheriff s capt shalon huff said one more was trapped wednesday morning leaving one still to be captured she said we re just lucky this hasn t happened before said susan fornash director of the madison oglethorpe animal shelter in danielsville where the captured dogs were held before being euthanized tuesday under orders from a local judge we ve had people bring in a dog because it killed a goat or chased their horses or something like that and to me that was just the forerunner of something like this investigators say they believe that university of georgia librarian sherry schweder 65 went for her usual morning walk saturday down howard thaxton road the narrow dirt lane that runs alongside the couple s property the dogs were familiar in the area investigators say having been left behind when the person who had been caring for some of them moved out of a home at the end of the lane authorities theorize that halfway down the lane about a quarter mile from her home sherry schweder was confronted by the dogs which knocked her down and killed her her husband retired uga language professor lothar schweder became concerned when she didn t return and went out in their honda crx to look for her when he found her lying in the lane and got out to shoo away the dogs they attacked and killed him too investigators believe although no blood was seen on the dogs other evidence and autopsy results convince authorities that the pack killed the schweders said jim fullington special agent in charge of the georgia bureau of investigation s office in nearby athens watch what investigators learned black bears occasionally pass through the area but none have been reported recently said sgt doyte chaffin a wildlife officer with the georgia department of natural resources investigators found no prints other than those of dogs and humans fullington added humans can appear threatening to dogs that run in packs said bonnie beaver a professor in the department of small animal clinical sciences at texas a m university and an expert in pack behavior from their perspective a person is an alien if you will beaver said it would be the same as we would relate to a grizzly bear dogs kill an average of 10 to 20 people each year in the united states beaver said the vast majority of those cases involve a single dog attacking a small child she said as few as two or three dogs whether urban suburban or rural can behave like a pack beaver said and when pack mentality takes over they do insane things that they would not do under normal circumstances she said my bet is there was one ringleader who kind of started it in the georgia case beaver said something as simple as making eye contact may have made one dog in the group feel threatened and its body language put the other dogs on edge triggering an escalation she said even though none of the dogs weighed more than about 40 pounds their numbers would have overwhelmed the victims screaming flailing or trying to run would only make things worse beaver said to be slight people as i m told they both were and the ages that they were i don t know what they could have done i don t know what i would do fornash said jehovah s witnesses walking up the lane to visit the lone house found the schweders mutilated bodies lying next to the car and called 911 fullington said he added that a sheriff s deputy had to fire a shot in the air to scare the dogs away the house the evangelists had intended to visit was unoccupied but it was home to at least some of the dogs fullington said the owner howard thaxton had moved out some months earlier because of health and financial problems but had someone drive him every other day to leave food for the dogs said gbi special agent christopher bish several empty 40 pound bags of ol roy dog food were strewn about the property tuesday thaxton an amputee who bish said was recently released from a hospital has been cooperating with authorities thaxton doesn t believe that those animals were capable of killing people law enforcement officials said he has not been charged we are still in discussions with the district attorney about culpability and what have you but no decisions have been reached yet bish said bish said it took 14 visits to thaxton s house to make initial contact with him cnn s efforts to find thaxton for comment were unsuccessful stopping the dogs from reproducing might have prevented the tragedy fornash said just a few dogs can multiply rapidly into a menace she added watch how dog bites might be prevented in the blink of an eye we have a pack of 50 dogs because people don t spay and neuter she said it took about 90 minutes to euthanize all 16 dogs several of which were maggot infested fornash said no one asked that they be checked for rabies and the sheriff directed that the carcasses be cremated immediately she said i m heartbroken for the family fornash said i can t even imagine how they must feel and i m also very sad for those animals because if they had been cared for the way they should have been this wouldn t have happened it s not their fault the schweders seven dogs and four of their cats were to be brought to the shelter wednesday and eventually adopted out she said thaxton s wood frame house that served as the dogs home sits at the edge of a forest dotted with hunting campers and abandoned 1950s vehicles empty 5 gallon water bottles fill a ravine behind the house and a derelict 1980s chevy caprice crouches next to a rusting john deere tractor under a shade tree after all the sheriff s deputies and trappers had left tuesday afternoon a scruffy red dog appeared ears up next to the tractor the animal alone scampered off into the woods \",\n

student has written a hilarious petition after she was snubbed for a meeting with us president barack obama ashley chandler posted a lengthy letter to the university which hosted a speech by obama on saturday on change org she called their decision not to invite her to the talk a scandal that would rank somewhere between watergate and the 2011 greenfield incident the 21 year old explained to daily mail australia that while her letter was a work of satire she is genuinely angry about how uq allocated the tickets to students the letter that i wrote is satire but it is being ridiculous as it points out how ridiculous their conduct has been she said scroll down for video university of queensland student ashley chandler wrote a petition after she wasn t invited to hear obama speak president barack obama at at the university of queensland in brisbane the fifth year law and political science student wrote i am naturally upset outraged hurt offended aggrieved by uq s decision not to invite me listing the reasons she believes she should have been invited ms chandler said i hold a leadership position in the university i am a scholarship student i have represented uq internationally was once on millionaire hot seat have seen all seven seasons of the west wing and hell i even went to college ms chandler said she was not the only student who was disappointed not to receive an invite there are many many students who have contributed much to the uq community who should have been offered the opportunity to attend some even more deserving than me maybe she wrote ms chandler hinted that she thought the university didn t invite her because she is a woman and added perhaps the worst thing about this entire process is that it seems to fly in the face of everything barack obama stands for he was the one who told us all that yes we can but literally we can t ashley chandler said the university had upset a lot of students by not inviting them to obama s speech mrs chandler hinted that she thought the university didn t invite her because she is a woman ms chandler said the decision flies in the face of what barack obama stands for she highlighted that the other two brisbane universities that handed out invites griffiths uni and qut had a much better system than qu 400 tickets were given to one small portion of the student body some of whom aren t even interested in politics and are just going for the hype of it ms chandler said she argued that there was a lack of transparency in the way the tickets were handed out there was a message from vice chancellor he said tight timeframes meant the tickets were given away to students that live on campus hundreds of students from brisbane s three main unis were invited to the speech but i don t think that really stacks up when students from other unis came to the speech she reasoned after watching obama s speech from her living room she said i thought it was ok but he was telling people what they wanted to hear to be honest it wasn t groundbreaking ms chandler said students are in the middle of their final block of exams and have not been told if they can even access the library this weekend while obama is in town one student told her he was turned away by security when he tried to hand in his work and told sorry it s going to have to be handed in late the law and political science student wrote i am naturally upset outraged hurt offended aggrieved ms chandler reasoned she was once on millionaire hot seat she wrote on her facebook page i have written this open letter to uq to express my concern over their handling of the obamagate affair \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n

we re just lucky this hasn t happened before said susan fornash director of the madison oglethorpe animal shelter in danielsville where the captured dogs were held before being euthanized tuesday under orders from a local judge we ve had people bring in a dog because it killed a goat or chased their horses or something like that and to me that was just the forerunner of something like this investigators say they believe that university of georgia librarian sherry schweder 65 went for her usual morning walk saturday down howard thaxton road the narrow dirt lane that runs alongside the couple s property the dogs were familiar in the area investigators say having been left behind when the person who had been caring for some of them moved out of a home at the end of the lane authorities theorize that halfway down the lane about a quarter mile from her home sherry schweder was confronted by the dogs which knocked her down and killed her her husband retired uga language professor lothar schweder became concerned when she didn t return and went out in their honda crx to look for her when he found her lying in the lane and got out to shoo away the dogs they attacked and killed him too investigators believe although no blood was seen on the dogs other evidence and autopsy results convince authorities that the pack killed the schweders said jim fullington special agent in charge of the georgia bureau of investigation s office in nearby athens watch what investigators learned black bears occasionally pass through the area but none have been reported recently said sgt doyte chaffin a wildlife officer with the georgia department of natural resources investigators found no prints other than those of dogs and humans fullington added humans can appear threatening to dogs that run in packs said bonnie beaver a professor in the department of small animal clinical sciences at texas a m university and an expert in pack behavior from their perspective a person is an alien if you will beaver said it would be the same as we would relate to a grizzly bear dogs kill an average of 10 to 20 people each year in the united states beaver said the vast majority of those cases involve a single dog attacking a small child she said as few as two or three dogs whether urban suburban or rural can behave like a pack beaver said and when pack mentality takes over they do insane things that they would not do under normal circumstances she said my bet is there was one ringleader who kind of started it in the georgia case beaver said something as simple as making eye contact may have made one dog in the group feel threatened and its body language put the other dogs on edge triggering an escalation she said even though none of the dogs weighed more than about 40 pounds their numbers would have overwhelmed the victims screaming flailing or trying to run would only make things worse beaver said to be slight people as i m told they both were and the ages that they were i don t know what they could have done i don t know what i would do fornash said jehovah s witnesses walking up the lane to visit the lone house found the schweders mutilated bodies lying next to the car and called 911 fullington said he added that a sheriff s deputy had to fire a shot in the air to scare the dogs away the house the evangelists had intended to visit was unoccupied but it was home to at least some of the dogs fullington said the owner howard thaxton had moved out some months earlier because of health and financial problems but had someone drive him every other day to leave food for the dogs said gbi special agent christopher bish several empty 40 pound bags of ol roy dog food were strewn about the property tuesday thaxton an amputee who bish said was recently released from a hospital has been cooperating with authorities thaxton doesn t believe that those animals were capable of killing people law enforcement officials said he has not been charged we are still in discussions with the district attorney about culpability and what have you but no decisions have been reached yet bish said bish said it took 14 visits to thaxton s house to make initial contact with him cnn s efforts to find thaxton for comment were unsuccessful stopping the dogs from reproducing might have prevented the tragedy fornash said just a few dogs can multiply rapidly into a menace she added watch how dog bites might be prevented in the blink of an eye we have a pack of 50 dogs because people don t spay and neuter she said it took about 90 minutes to euthanize all 16 dogs several of which were maggot infested fornash said no one asked that they be checked for rabies and the sheriff directed that the carcasses be cremated immediately she said i m heartbroken for the family fornash said i can t even imagine how they must feel and i m also very sad for those animals because if they had been cared for the way they should have been this wouldn t have happened it s not their fault the schweders seven dogs and four of their cats were to be brought to the shelter wednesday and eventually adopted out she said thaxton s wood frame house that served as the dogs home sits at the edge of a forest dotted with hunting campers and abandoned 1950s vehicles empty 5 gallon water bottles fill a ravine behind the house and a derelict 1980s

greenfield incident the 21 year old explained to daily mail australia that while her letter was a work of satire she is genuinely angry about how uq allocated the tickets to students the letter that i wrote is satire but it is being ridiculous as it points out how ridiculous their conduct has been she said scroll down for video university of queensland student ashley chandler wrote a petition after she wasn t invited to hear obama speak president barack obama at at the university of queensland in brisbane the fifth year law and political science student wrote i am naturally upset outraged hurt offended aggrieved by uq s decision not to invite me listing the reasons she believes she should have been invited ms chandler said i hold a leadership position in the university i am a scholarship student i have represented uq internationally was once on millionaire hot seat have seen all seven seasons of the west wing and hell i even went to college ms chandler said she was not the only student who was disappointed not to receive an invite there are many many students who have contributed much to the uq community who should have been offered the opportunity to attend some even more deserving than me maybe she wrote ms chandler hinted that she thought the university didn t invite her because she is a woman and added perhaps the worst thing about this entire process is that it seems to fly in the face of everything barack obama stands for he was the one who told us all that yes we can but literally we can t ashley chandler said the university had upset a lot of students by

student body some of whom aren t even interested in politics and are just going for the hype of it ms chandler said she argued that there was a lack of transparency in the way the tickets were handed out there was a message from vice chancellor he said tight timeframes meant the tickets were given away to students that live on campus hundreds of students from brisbane s three main unis were invited to the speech but i don t think that really stacks up when students from other unis came to the speech she reasoned after watching obama s speech from her living room she said i thought it was ok but he was telling people what they wanted to hear to be honest it wasn t groundbreaking ms chandler said students are in the middle of their final block of exams and have not been told if they can
